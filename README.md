# Grandpa Stories App

A collection of short stories about a grandpa named Fred Fondeur. After dad passed, we created a memory jar and wrote as many stories as we could remember to share with the kids. They ask almost every night. I thought, "maybe I can make a little app for that." This way we can read them from the tablet, wherever we are.
